# GRA.Web/css

This folder contains vendor CSS scripts which are updated with the top level `dev/docker-yarn-update.sh` script. When that script is run, the contents of this directory are erased.

If you want to add project-specific CSS files please add them in the `GRA.Web/Styles` folder and ensure they are minified in `Startup.cs`.
